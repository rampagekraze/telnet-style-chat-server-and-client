# telnet-style-chat-server-and-client
this server and client were programmed in python. they are really simple and you can edit them using any text editor. to run, find your IP adress and then open chatclient. close to the beginning there is a line that says '192.168.17.*' replace the number with your IP. open a terminal window and type "python " then the location of the chatserver file. instead of writing the location, you can drag the icon into the teminal window. then hit return/enter. go to the file menu and select shell - new window. in that window type "python " then the chatclient location. it should ask you to log in, so just type any username and that name will apear infront of your posts. to quit the client, type /quit. to quit the server, control-c.
